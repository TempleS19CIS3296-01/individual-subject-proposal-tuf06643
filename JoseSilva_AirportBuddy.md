## Overall Project
  Airport Buddy is an open source android application on GitHub. An Android app that displays the user's flight imformation. It helps with
  some of the struggles when going to the airport. This app allows the user to check out their route to the airport and report back
  the estimated arrival time. Reports the time it will take to get through TSA checkpoint and flight information, such as time remaining
  until flight begins boarding.
