## Overall Project
  Airport Buddy is an open source android application on GitHub. An Android app that displays the user's flight imformation. It helps with
  some of the struggles when going to the airport. This app allows the user to check out their route to the airport and report back
  the estimated arrival time. Reports the time it will take to get through TSA checkpoint and flight information, such as time remaining
  until flight begins boarding. 

## Educational Goals
  Many educational goals can be met through this project. Test driven development is met through this project, having to make sure that
only faces that are stored in the data base pass the test. Database programming will also be met in this project ideally we want to be able
to access a database of faces. Making sure to be able to successfully access and traverse the database. 
  
## Proposed Contribution
  I propose to use the facial recognition module
