## Overall Project
  Airport Buddy is an open source android application on GitHub. An Android app that displays the user's flight imformation. It helps with
  some of the struggles when going to the airport. This app allows the user to check out their route to the airport and report back
  the estimated arrival time. Reports the time it will take to get through TSA checkpoint and flight information, such as time remaining
  until flight begins boarding. This project was created using Java and XML in Android Studio by a team of 4.

## Educational Goals
  Many educational goals can be met through this project. Test driven development can be met through this project which is 
  important when developing to make sure that features are working like they are suppose too. Object oriented design will be met
  through this project since we are going to have multiple classes such as adapters,activities, and other Android applicatons 
  working together. Since this is an android app XML (extensible markup language) will be used. Design patterns is something I believe
  will be met through this project as the app already has multiple parts checking to see how these parts are design and find a pattern 
  is important as instead of just throwing in our modifications and then adjusting everything. It might be better to design my new 
  feature in a similar style as the creators have just to make it flow better and easier. 
  
## Proposed Contribution
  I propose to add a new feature to this project. I would like to create a feature that will display the user with information about
  what is going on in the area of travel. In another class, User Experience Design,  my partner and I suggested doing a similar idea,
  the user will enter their final destination and area where they will be staying at the application will then scrape through the web
  and find activities happening in that area. At the moment will just keep it with major activities happening that day but if allowed will
  would want to extend to allow the user to enter specific categories of interest.
